# Heart-Disease-Model
####We used a heart dataset in which  13 independent features are given and we have to predict the target which means a person have a heart disease or not. Firstly we will perform data preprocessing and exploratory data analysis. After processing and visualisation we will move towards model implementation which will be done by sklearn library. After model implementation we will evaluate the models and see their performance and we will check that any model is overfitted.If any model is overfitted then we will apply cross validation or hyperparameter tuning to increase it's performance.

#Appendix
In this classification model we used different algorithms and compared their accuracies. The algorithms used are - KNN, Decision Tree and Naive Bayes.
